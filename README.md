# Padrões Comportamentais

## Façade

The intent of the Façade is to provide a high-level interface (properties and methods) that makes a subsystem or toolkit easy to use for the client.

## Chain of Responsability

The Chain of Responsibility pattern provides a chain of loosely coupled objects one of which can satisfy a request. This pattern is essentially a linear search for an object that can handle a particular request.
